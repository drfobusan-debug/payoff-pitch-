# Testing the payoff-pitch MLB engine end-to-end

## Environment
- Venv at repo root: `source .venv/bin/activate`.
- Odds pricing reads `THE_ODDS_API_KEY`, falling back to `ODDS_API_KEY`. If neither is set the
  engine silently prices everything off a synthetic -110, which makes any pricing/tier test
  meaningless. Always assert the produced workbook has many distinct `Book Odds` and several
  distinct `Book` names before drawing conclusions (a healthy 15-game slate gave ~780 priced rows,
  ~200 distinct prices, 11-12 books).
- The app's "today" may be a simulated future date; check `date` on the box and use a slate date
  the engine has data for.
- Check remaining Odds API credits before planning multiple full runs:
  `curl -s -D - -o /dev/null "https://api.the-odds-api.com/v4/sports/?apiKey=$ODDS_API_KEY" | grep x-requests`
  A full `run` costs ~135 credits (15 events x 9 markets).

## Commands
- Full slate: `python -m mlb_engine.cli run --date YYYY-MM-DD --sims 800`
  (~2 min; writes `~/.mlb_engine/output/mlb_recommendations_<date>.xlsx` and pushes state to an
  `engine-state` git branch as a normal side effect — don't fight it).
- `python -m mlb_engine.cli audit --date YYYY-MM-DD` only prints metrics and refreshes
  `ledger.xlsx`. **The md/HTML/PDF audit report is only written when you pass `--report`**
  (`--email` also triggers it). Do not conclude the PDF is broken because timestamps did not change.
- Gates: `python -m pytest -q`, `ruff check mlb_engine cfb_engine tests`, `mypy mlb_engine cfb_engine`.

## Verifying tier / threshold behaviour
- Tier config lives in `mlb_engine/config.py` (`EVThresholds`), classification in
  `mlb_engine/market/tiers.py:classify`. Env knobs: `MLBE_MIN_EV`, `MLBE_MIN_EDGE`,
  `MLBE_EDGE_STRONG_GAP`, `MLBE_MAX_EDGE`, `MLBE_STRONG_ONLY`, each with a `_<MARKET>` suffix
  override (e.g. `MLBE_MAX_EDGE_GAME_ML`). Exercise these against `EVThresholds().for_market(...)`
  and `classify()` in a subprocess per env combination — env is read at dataclass construction,
  so setting `os.environ` in an already-imported process is unreliable.
- Cheap way to prove an env knob changes real selections without paying for another slate: read
  the `All` sheet of an existing workbook, rebuild synthetic `EVResult`s from its EV/Edge columns,
  and re-run `classify` under different env in a subprocess.
- Rows that legitimately sit outside the classify gate when auditing a workbook:
  - `Market == comeback` — informational resilience flags tiered in
    `pipeline.py:_comeback_recs`, no EV/edge/odds at all. Exclude them from gate invariants.
  - `Market == game_ml` with `ml-upgrade` in Notes — `MLSharpGate.upgrades`
    (`mlb_engine/features/ml_gate.py`) promotes a vetoed PASS row to Moderate on VSIN sharp money,
    after strong_only is applied, so these can show negative EV/edge and plus-money prices.
  - Tiers can also be bumped ±1 by run-line signals (`runline_adjustment`), so a Strong row can sit
    below `min_edge + strong_edge_gap` and a Moderate row above it. Don't assert a hard
    Strong/Moderate edge split; assert the gate band instead.

## Reading the Excel
- `openpyxl` is available. Sheets: `Strong Buys`, `Moderate Buys`, `Fades`, four family tabs, `All`.
- `All` has full columns (`Market`, `EV`, `Edge`, `Book Odds`, `Tier`, `Notes`); the grid sheets have
  a `Best` column and format `Odds` as strings like `+107` / `n/a`, so parse defensively.
- Row shading interpolates a per-class light->neon pair (see `_SCHEMES` in `output/excel.py`) with
  `t = 0.15 + 0.7 * (conv - lo) / (hi - lo)`. To test the gradient, read `cell.fill.fgColor.rgb`
  and solve for `t` by least squares across all three channels — the green channel alone is nearly
  flat in the yellow (Moderate) scheme. Expect inversions of ~0.005 in `t` between rows whose
  displayed edge is equal to 3 dp; that is rounding, not a bug.
- To view a workbook visually: `sudo apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends libreoffice-calc`
  then `libreoffice --calc <path>` (dismiss the "Tip of the Day" dialog and the notification bar
  before screenshotting). PDFs render fine in Chrome via a `file:///` URL.

## Devin Secrets Needed
- `ODDS_API_KEY` or `THE_ODDS_API_KEY` — required for real market prices.
- `GMAIL_USER` / `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD` — only needed for `--email`; do not send email while testing.
